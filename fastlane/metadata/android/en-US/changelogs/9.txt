First bugs hunted! This version fixes two problems found:

- One of the bugs made the choice questions not being properly saved. Thanks to the hunters diesendungmitdermaus, mziehm, igor-cali and hoschi-it.

- Now, the time choosers have the same format as the default device's locale.

Some old entries may not be displayed as intended to be saved. If you chose a second option in the forms (No/Outdoors), when you open the contact the first option (Yes/Indoors) will be selected instead. The only way of fixing this at the moment is manually (just once), so please take your time doing so right after updating the app.
