This version brings quite a few new features, with two important ones.

- The time of the contact is no longer asked, because it is largely irrelevant. Instead, now the forms ask for the duration of the contact.
- App shortcuts (thanks to GenosseFlosse). Long-pressing the app's icon will show a menu with shortcuts for adding contacts without entering the app. You can also create menu icons with these shortcuts.

- Since credit must be given where credit is due, a section with acknowledgments has been added.
- Some bugs have been squashed, including the visualization of risky contacts only.
- New translations are available: Polish (thanks to wasikr7), Finnish (thanks to Mikko95) and Indonesian (thanks to hexatester).
- Small fixes in the other translations.
