This update brings two major improvements in usability:

- A Notes field has been added to the forms, so you can insert additional information that may think relevant.
- Now you can make a copy of an older entry in today's list with the new Make a Copy Today option.

In addition, there are a few less bugs, and there is a new link to rate the app in the Options menu.
