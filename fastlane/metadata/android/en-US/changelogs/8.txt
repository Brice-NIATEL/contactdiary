First bugs hunted! This version fixes two problems found:

- One of the bugs made the choice questions not being properly saved. Thanks to the hunters diesendungmitdermaus, mziehm, igor-cali and hoschi-it.

- Now, the time choosers have the same format as the default device's locale.

This update does not erase any information in the forms, in contrast with v1.1.1
